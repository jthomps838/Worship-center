                  Storm to Shore was born from a deep understanding of life's inevitable storms. 
                  Just as Jesus called His disciples to follow Him across turbulent waters, 
                  we believe that every storm in our lives is an opportunity to draw closer to Christ 
                  and discover His unfailing love and faithfulness.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Our founder experienced firsthand how God's grace can transform the darkest seasons 
                  into testimonies of hope. Through personal struggles with loss, uncertainty, and doubt, 
                  the Lord revealed His character as our anchor in the storm and our safe harbor when 
                  the waves seem overwhelming.
                </p>
                
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  We understand that life's challenges can feel isolating, but Scripture reminds us 
                  that we are not meant to walk this journey alone. Storm to Shore exists to provide 
                  a community where people can share their burdens, receive prayer support, and 
                  discover the peace that surpasses all understanding.
